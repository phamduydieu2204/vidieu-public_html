#### API

The plugin also offers additional endpoints for manipulating licenses and generator resources. These routes are authorized via API keys (generated through the plugin settings) and accessed via the WordPress API. An extensive [API documentation](https://www.licensemanager.at/docs/rest-api/getting-started/api-keys) is also available.

#### Need help?

If you have any feature requests, need more hooks, or maybe have even found a bug, please let us know in the support forum or e-mail us at <support@wpexperts.io>. We look forward to hearing from you!

You can also check out the documentation pages, as they contain the most essential information on what the plugin can do for you.

#### Important

The plugin will create two files inside the `wp-content/uploads/lmfwc-files` folder. These files (`defuse.txt` and `secret.txt`) contain cryptographic secrets which are automatically generated if they don't exist. These cryptographic secrets are used to encrypt, decrypt and hash your license keys. Once they are generated please **back them up somewhere safe**. In case you lose these two files your encrypted license keys inside the database will remain forever lost!

If you would like to contribute to any of these [libraries](https://www.licensemanager.at/docs/rest-api/libraries/nodejs) in these languages (Node.js, Python, PHP, Ruby, .NET, C, C#, C++, and Golang), please visit our library page for more details.

#### Note

Few features like user license display on account page and license certification are fork from Digital License Manager plugin by Darko Gjorgjijoski and we have changed the code according to our need.
